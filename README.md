# Blockchain-Insurance-Fraud-Detection

## Introduction

Insurance can be exposed to numerous fraud schemes. For example, a new applicant can commit fraud by withholding critical information or filing a claim on behalf of ineligible dependents. This project aims to reduce insurance fraud by leveraging blockchain technology. Blockchain offers opportunities for innovation in data exchange, claims processing, and fraud prevention within the insurance industry. By recording medical procedures and timestamps on a blockchain platform, compliance and verification of medical services rendered can be improved.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to utilize blockchain technology to reduce insurance fraud. It aims to automate manual processes, reduce errors, and expedite processing times in the insurance industry. By storing information on plan participants, entitlements, and claim data, blockchain can streamline operations, improve data quality, and increase trust between parties.

## Scope

The scope of this project includes people applying for medical insurance, insurance companies, and hospitals involved in the medical history of the patient.

## Smart Contracts

Smart contracts enable transparent and trustless transactions on the blockchain. In the context of insurance, smart contracts can be used to track insurance claims, enforce policy rules, and hold both parties accountable. Insurance policies can be written as decentralized smart contracts, where individuals agree to pay premiums in return for the insurance company's promise to cover their future medical costs. If false or fraudulent claims are made, smart contracts can dissolve automatically, ensuring fair outcomes and mutual trust.

## Code

The smart contract code is written in Solidity and can be found in the `Insurance.sol` file in this repository. The contract includes functionalities such as defining entities, policy details, policy status, claim amounts, and recording medical procedures. It also provides functions for users to make claims and for hospitals to record procedures.

## Installation

To run the code locally, follow these steps:

1. Install [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache).
2. Install [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle).
3. Clone this repository.
4. Open Ganache and start a new workspace.
5. In the project directory, run `truffle migrate` to deploy the smart contract.
6. In the project directory, run `npm start` to start the local server.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates how blockchain technology can be leveraged to reduce insurance fraud. By utilizing smart contracts, manual processes can be automated, leading to improved efficiency, cost reduction, enhanced customer experience, improved data quality, and increased trust between parties. The potential impact on the insurance industry is significant, as blockchain provides opportunities for innovation and disruption in traditional processes.

Feel free to contribute to this project by providing feedback, suggestions, or enhancements. Together, we can drive the adoption of blockchain technology in the insurance sector and mitigate fraud risks.
